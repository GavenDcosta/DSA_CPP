STL = Containers + Algorithms + Iterators

Containers -> Object which stores data
Algorithms -> Procedure to process data
Iterators -> Object which points to a element in a container


Container Types:
- Sequence Containers => Stores data in Linear Fashion (Vector, List, DEqueue)   => Stores in form of a Line
- Associative Containers => Direct access to Elements (Set, Map, multi set, multi map) => Stores in form of a Tree
- Derived Containers => Derived from sequence and associative containers => Real World Modelling (Stack, Queue, Priority Queue)


When to Use ?

Sequence Containers 
1. Vector - Random Access = Fast       [like Array]
            Insertion/Deletion = Slow
            Insertion at End = Fast

2. List - Random Access = Slow  [like Linked List]
          Insertion in Middle and End = Fast
          Deletion in Middle and End = Fast


Associative Containers
- All operations Fast except Random Access    

Derived Containers
- Deoends on the Data Structure used
